This repo contains various small C codes using PolyLib that I wrote during
time. It's supposed to provide some PolyLib library usage examples.

For example, imscan2 performs the image of a polyhedron and generate its
scanning loops using the Fourier-Motzkin implementation in PolyLib, and
pretty-prints the output.

Feel free to reuse, modify, do whatever you want to with these codes, without
any guarantee.

Good luck!
